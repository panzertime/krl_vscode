# krl README

This is a Visual Studio Code extension that supports syntax highlighting for KRL (Kinetic Rule Language).  Based on a grammar borrowed from [kitsune7's Atom package](https://github.com/kitsune7/language-krl).  I may eventually add some primitive linting via the Language Server API, but probably not.
